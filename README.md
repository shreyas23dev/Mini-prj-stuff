#  Methodology: 
  The methodology outlined below presents a systematic, multi-stage approach 
designed to enhance vulnerability prioritization by integrating three critical 
dimensions of cyber risk: severity (CVSS), exploitability (EPSS), and adversary 
behavior (MITRE ATT&CK). Each step contributes to the development of a unified 
scoring framework that reflects both technical impact and real-world threat relevance, 
thereby enabling more informed and effective remediation strategies. 
## a) Collect Data:
  Collect CVE data from NVD, exploit likelihood from EPSS, 
  and attack technique info from MITRE ATT&CK. 
## b) Clean & Prepare:
  Organize CVEs, remove duplicates, and handle missing 
  values
